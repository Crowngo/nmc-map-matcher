The NMC Map Matcher is designed takes a set of georeference points,
such as GTFS, GPS tracks, etc., and project them to an underlying node-
link representation of a transportation network. The algorithm follows a
scheme of maintaining multiple candidate paths that is effective in
dealing with ambiguities in the mapping.

This is currently a first cut, however!  The code has been very useful
for research activities at the Network Modeling Center, but a number of
inefficiencies and needed features abound that are described in the
blog. I welcome opportunities to collaborate in making this code better.
I also appreciate hearing where this code may come in handy. (Keep in
mind that transportation research need not be the only domain for the
map matcher code.)

This code accompanies this paper which introduces how it all works:

This Python project consists of several entry-points that are
documented at the project website on GitHub.
