The NMC Map Matcher is designed to take a set of georeference points,
such as GTFS, GPS tracks, etc., and project them to an underlying node-
link representation of a transportation network. The algorithm 
maintains multiple candidate paths, which turns out to be very effective
in dealing with a variety of ambiguities in the mapping.

This is currently a first cut, however! The code has been very useful
for research activities at the Network Modeling Center, but a number of
efficiencies and features are needed that are described in the blog.
I welcome opportunities to collaborate in making this code better. I
also appreciate hearing where this code comes in handy. (Keep in mind
that transportation research need not be the only domain for this map
matcher code. This may be applied to a variety of problems that deal
with error minimizations, etc.)

This code accompanies this paper:

This Python project consists of several entry-points that are
documented at the project website on GitHub.
